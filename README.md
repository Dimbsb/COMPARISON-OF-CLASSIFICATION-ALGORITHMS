# COMPARISON-OF-CLASSIFICATION-ALGORITHMS

This program compares the insertionsort, improved_quicksort, and nonrec_mergesort sorting algorithms and runs them on arrays of dimension 10,000
up to 100,000 with a step of 10,000 and for each dimension it creates 10 different
snapshots of random number tables. 
The goal of this project is to find which is the fastest algorithm for classification among them.
